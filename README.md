- **Leverage Popular Products:** Introduce bundled deals & subscriptions for Staples & Office Supplies to boost repeat sales and customer retention.
- **Improve Logistics & Operations:** Reduce shipping and warehousing costs, particularly in Texas & Illinois, to improve the profit-to-revenue ratio. Consider regional pricing adjustments or targeted promotions to attract high-margin customers.
- **Enhance Seasonal & Stock Planning:** Ensure inventory readiness for peak demand in Q3 & Q4, and implement early-bird promotions to maximize sales. Allocate more marketing budget to later quarters when customers are most active.
- Continuously analyze product performance, market trends, and operational efficiency to refine strategies.
